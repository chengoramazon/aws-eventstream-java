# AWS EventStream for Java

AWS EventStream for Java is a Java implementation of EventStream encoding. EventStream is an extensible binary datagram encoding used for communication between AWS services. This library allows you to encode and decode EventStream messages in your Java applications, enabling seamless integration with AWS services.

## Usage

To use this library, you need to include it as a dependency in your Java project. You can do this by adding the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>

    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

You can then import the library in your Java code and use it to encode and decode EventStream messages. Here is an example:

```java
import com.amazonaws.eventstream.*;

// Your code here
```
